## Carboard / Paper

Clean paper/cardboard can be picked up by [Arc-en-ciel](https://www.arcenciel.org/activities/sorting-centers-for-recyclable-waste/) if they are of sufficient quantity.

## Cans (Coke, Pepsi, etc.)

You will find groups that pick up these, however what I do, is I collect them and leave a bag full of crushed cans in my trunk. From time to time, when I see someone scavenging garbage bins, I would stop the car and give them the bag. These people usually know where to sell these by the weight.
