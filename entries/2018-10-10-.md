Performance on my Debian desktop is a bit sluggish, with Chrome. The CPU governor is set to `ondemand` so I tried to set it to `performance`.

```
sudo cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance
sudo cpufreq-set -c 1 -g performance
sudo cpufreq-set -c 2 -g performance
sudo cpufreq-set -c 3 -g performance
cpufreq-info
```

I can see that now the CPU frequency is stuck on maximum for all CPUs. But I'm not sure that I see a definite improvement.

I'm thinking of replacing Linux with Windows 7 on this machine. It may be a better option productivity wise.
However I may like Linux more even though it can be broken, unreliable and distracting.
