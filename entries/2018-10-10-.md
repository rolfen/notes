Performance on my Debian desktop is a bit sluggish, with Chrome. The CPU governor is set to `ondemand` so I tried to set it to `performance`.

```
sudo cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance
sudo cpufreq-set -c 1 -g performance
sudo cpufreq-set -c 2 -g performance
sudo cpufreq-set -c 3 -g performance
cpufreq-info
```

I can see that now the CPU frequency is stuck on maximum for all CPUs. But I'm not sure that I see a definite improvement.

I'm thinking of replacing Linux with Windows 7 on this machine. It may be a better option productivity wise.
However I may like Linux more even though it can be broken, unreliable and distracting.

## The Network Manager Command Line Client

When I first experimented with Linux, over a decade ago, setting up a network interface was a matter of editing `ifup`  and `ifdown` scripts.

Nowadays NetworkManager does all the work. There are various GUIs that interact with network manager. On the command line, you get `nmcli`.

Show available connections:
```
$ nmcli connection show 
NAME               UUID                                  TYPE             DEVICE          
MyWifi             6de4fc47-04b7-4d00-bb6b-3c1d0f5929f7  802-11-wireless  wlx0014d14c50b2 
Ethernet over USB  1e07dd93-d562-41d2-a9e7-c05dfe320708  802-3-ethernet   enp0s26f7u4i3   
My4G               7f0bc1be-dd18-4d37-b70c-0c6c412ff48c  gsm              --              
Badaboom           3cce5d75-528e-48aa-b51a-e8217e274483  802-11-wireless  --              
```

You can also type `nmcli connection` and will default to showing all connections. 

< Insert some more stuff here >

`nmcli` commands can be abbreviated, for example `nmcli connection up 
MyWifi`  can be written `nmcli c u MyWifi`  (connection names cannot be abbreviated).
