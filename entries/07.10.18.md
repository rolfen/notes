Today, I start this blog thing.

The core idea is to document tech work so that:
- It can serve as a reference later on
- It can help others with similar difficulties
- Bring credit and recognition to my skills

I have privacy concerns - to keep things simple, I might just put all the personal and other non-tech stuff (in which I would be identifiable) in another blog.

The content is hosted on github. It can be edited online through stackedit.io or prose.io
