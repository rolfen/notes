## The blog thing

Today, I start this blog thing.

The core idea is to document tech work so that:
- It can serve as a reference later on
- It can help others with similar difficulties
- Bring credit and recognition to my skills

I have privacy concerns - to keep things simple, I might just put all the personal and other non-tech stuff in another blog.

The content is hosted on github. It can be edited online through stackedit.io or prose.io.

I have yet to see how I will be pulishing it. Maybe Jeckyll, I guess.


## LDAP on Debian

After setting up a mail server using [Thomas Leister's great article](https://thomas-leister.de/en/mailserver-debian-stretch/), I started looking into LDAP, mainly for storing user passwords.

Yesterday, I managed to set up a rudimentary LDAP service (slapd).

As next step, I'm looking into LDAP clients
