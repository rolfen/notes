## Checking out Weston


I remember using Weston and finding it somewhat immature and buggy. I like it but when I use it for a while I start to get annoyed by all the bugs.

Anyways I tried to experiment with Weston on my Debian desktop again. Weston was at version 1.12 on my maching and copy-paste did not do anytyhing. I tried to upgrade weston, and I had forgotten how unintuitive the apt-get upgrade command is for a single package

	apt-get install --only-upgrade weston

Of course, at first I had tried

	apt-get upgrade weston

However this command ignores the package name and tries to upgrade everyting on my system.

I tried upgrading weston from testing or unstable and it claimed (falsely) that I had the latest version for some reason.

At a later stage I did managed to upgrade to Weston 4.
Now copy-paste works but it is still only works in some conditions and somewhat randomly fails.


## Sending an SMS using mmcli

When I plug my Android phone into my Linux Desktop, I can see a GSM modem device appearing. I can use that to get 4G on my computer. I had seen an article about sending SMS on Linux, and have been wanting to try this.

I will try to use `mmcli` which appears to me as a modern, user friendly and mainstream option.

This article outlines the procudure:

https://itgrenade.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/use-mmcli-for-sending-sms/

So basically:

List modems. Take note of modem # to use in the next command:

	mmcli -L

Create an SMS on modem # 0. Take note of the SMS # in the output:

	sudo mmcli -m 0 --messaging-create-sms="text='Hello world',number='+1234567890'"

Send SMS # 0:

	sudo mmcli -s 0 --send

This worked.

Then I tried to send SMS and to my number and receive them on the computer, but it seems that Android gets a hold of them and they never get to the computer. I guess I'll need a dedicated GSM modem for that.


## Trying again with Jekyll

I still have not managed to get a list of pages on my Jekyll blog. I remember that I did manage this in the past, somehow. Anyway I'll give up for now, I'm happy with how each individual page displays, and I'll patch up something to create an index later on, I guess.

This is really frustrating, now I'm getting a 404 for almost anything and cannot find a way to even display blog entriles by their URL. How unhelpful.

Since I gave up on Jekyll being useful, I reverted to my initial directory naming, maybe now it will work again, like it did initially. I guess `_post` has a special meaning.
